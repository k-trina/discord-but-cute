# discord-but-make-it-cute
Custom theme for Discord on browser using CSS. Originally for personal use to make my experience more fun and pink :)

I use a CSS override extension for Chrome (specifically [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha)) to code and use customized web themes.
